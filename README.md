# üê∑ Pig-Game üê∑
Simple dice game which can be played with 2 people. The game ends when one player have scored greater than 100.
Written in pure JS, but possibly this is not what you want to know about but more about the rules of the game.



### Intended Gameplay


On a turn, a player rolls the dice as many times until the dice number is 1.
When the dice number is 1 the play will switch to the other playe and his current score will be reset to 0r.
Before the 1 number displayed if the player holds the score then the current score will added to the base score of the user
Finally, the player which reaches 100 will win the game.
